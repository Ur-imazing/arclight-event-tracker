All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.21.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- **Swift Package Manager support**: Repository now ships a `Package.swift` manifest exposing `arclight_event_tracker` as an SPM library product (iOS 12+). Existing CocoaPods consumers are unchanged; SPM consumers can now add the package via `https://github.com/JesusFilm/arclight-event-tracker.git`.

### Notes
- Single Objective-C target (`arclight_event_tracker`) at `Pod/Classes`. `EventTracker.h` and `JFMReachability.h` are exposed as public headers via SPM's umbrella header convention.
- Frameworks linked: UIKit, CoreData, MapKit, CoreLocation. Library: `sqlite3`.
- Required by [JesusFilm-iOS JAPP-232](https://linear.app/jesus-film-project/issue/JAPP-232) (CocoaPods → SPM migration).
